This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# TODO
* Change web property filters to radios (or disable/hide sub filters when more than one filter selected)
* Update state to combine web property filters into one object, automatically set value based on filter value so less code to update
* Refactor so easy to contribute other properties' sub-filters
* Incorporate additional options: spelling suggestion, heading headline em
* Update headline em style
